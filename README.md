Many start learning to code to get a high paying job in the tech industry, others want to learn coding as a hobby. Some people, like myself, are not happy sitting idle while there is so much in this world to take in. If something in your life is so integrated in everything you do, and is so important that you can’t leave home without it, wouldn’t you want to understand how it works? Or, better yet, harness it to make it work for you rather than rely on others to tell you what you need.
